## Parkinson Prediction Project

Welcome to the Parkinson Prediction Project repository! This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict Parkinson's disease based on patient data. The system is designed to assist healthcare professionals by providing a tool for early diagnosis and intervention.

### Overview
The Parkinson Prediction Project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment steps.

### Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, normalizes data, and extracts features.
- **Model Training:** Trains multiple machine learning models to find the best predictor.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the performance of models using various metrics.
- **Prediction:** Provides a user-friendly interface for making predictions on new patient data.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SanskrutiDhal/Parkinson-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration
1. **Dataset:**
   - Ensure that the dataset is in the correct format and placed in the appropriate directory as specified in the project.

### Usage
1. **Preprocess the Data:**
   - Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
     ```
     python preprocess.py
     ```

2. **Train the Model:**
   - Run the training script to train the machine learning model:
     ```
     python train_model.py
     ```

3. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Evaluate the trained model using the evaluation script:
     ```
     python evaluate_model.py
     ```

4. **Make Predictions:**
   - Use the prediction script to make predictions on new patient data:
     ```
     python predict.py --input new_patient_data.csv
     ```
